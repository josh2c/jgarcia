            <p>Chasing a dream means sending out calls into the void, over 1,000 emails, messages, calls. Most get silence. A few spark back, but dead ends stack up fast. It's the game. No one hands you an easy win, but every unanswered shot builds something, resilience, maybe hope.</p>

            <p>The dream's worth it, some see it already, and soon more will. Those early believers? They're gold. Why push when the world's quiet? What keeps anyone swinging when replies don't come? It's the faith in what's coming, the small wins that light the way.</p>
