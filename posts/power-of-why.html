            <p>Every chase kicks off with a why, that quiet nudge that won't let go. It's the root under the noise, the thread that holds when everything else frays.</p>
            
            <p>Big wins sit way out there, hazy on the horizon, but this one question keeps the wheels spinning. It's not the loud victories or the flashy moments, it's the steady burn that says keep going.</p>
            
            <p>Look at anything that's lasted, every spark came from someone asking why and then digging in. Doubt rolls in heavy sometimes, the grind gets thick, but that why cuts through it all.</p>
            
            <p>It's not just a thought, it's fuel, deep and relentless. Chasing it turns a slog into something alive, something that pulls you forward even when the path's rough.</p>
            
            <p>Small steps pile up because of it, each one a brick in something bigger. The payoff's not instant, but it's real, a slow build that turns into gold over time.</p>
            
            <p>That's the power, it's not about speed or scale, it's about staying lit when the world's dark. Every move counts when it's tied to that core, and the fire doesn't fade if you feed it right.</p>
