            <p>Vision carries heft, it's not a light thing. Starts as a flicker, a whisper in the back of your mind, then digs in deep. It's not vague or soft, it's sharp, cuts through the clutter like a blade.</p>
            
            <p>What lasts always had it, a clear line from thought to reality, unbending even when the noise piles up. That weight doesn't just sit, it pulls, draws others in when they feel it too.</p>
            
            <p>It's not dreaming, it's building, brick by brick, step by step. Takes grit, no question, the road's rough and long. But the good ones stand because of it, they don't fade or flop.</p>
            
            <p>That's the kick, a vision that sticks isn't a wish, it's a force, as solid as stone. Noise comes and goes, distractions blur the edges, but the core holds tight.</p>
            
            <p>Look at what's shaped us, it wasn't random, it was seen clear and chased hard. It's not about flash or speed, it's about depth, something that roots and grows.</p>
            
            <p>That weight's the anchor, it's what turns a thought into a mark no one can ignore.</p>
